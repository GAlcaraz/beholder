# Tedium
Tedium dives deep into the corners of history, culture, and media that are often overlooked, presenting its readers with one in-depth, over-the-top story with each issue. Rather than providing a broad overview of current events, Tedium takes a single topic and explores it from all angles, uncovering the fascinating details that are usually missed in traditional news coverage. This bi-weekly newsletter is perfect for curious minds who love to delve into the quirks and oddities of our world.
