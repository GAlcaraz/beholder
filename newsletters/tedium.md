# Tedium
Tedium focuses on the untold stories, diving deep into the underappreciated and often overlooked aspects of culture, history, and technology. Unlike typical news outlets that offer quick summaries of the world's happenings, Tedium chooses instead to provide comprehensive and engaging narratives about singular, captivating topics.

## Newsletter Features
- **In-depth Analysis:** Each issue dedicates itself to unraveling the complexities of a single topic, ensuring readers receive a thorough understanding of the subject at hand.
- **Unique Stories:** Content often highlights obscure or neglected stories that aren't found in mainstream media outlets, catering to curious minds looking for something different.
- **Bi-Weekly Schedule:** A steady, manageable flow of content, perfect for readers who appreciate quality over quantity.

## Writing Style
Tediumâ€™s writing style can be described as detail-oriented, engaging, and approachable. It avoids the pitfall of dryness that some might expect from in-depth reports, maintaining a balance between informative and entertaining.

## Pricing
Tedium is a completely free-to-read newsletter, inviting a broad audience of readers eager to dive deep into fascinating stories without the barrier of a subscription fee.

## Authors and Background
Launched in 2015, Tedium is the brainchild of journalists and storytellers who sought to counter the trend of bite-sized journalism. With over 12,000 subscribers, it has found a dedicated reader base that appreciates its unique approach to storytelling.

## Additional Resources
While the primary content of Tedium is its newsletter, the website itself hosts an archive of all past issues, enriching the reader's experience by offering easy access to its vast repertoire of stories.
