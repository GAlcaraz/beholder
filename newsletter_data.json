Alex Johnson works in marketing for FICO, an analytics company that helps businesses with decision making. Instead of writing about weekly news, he focuses more on current trends. For example, at the time of writing (November 2020), Fintech trends include Banking as a Service and Buy Now Pay Later - so he’ll write a newsletter diving deep into those topics. He also sometimes interviews interesting guests which integrate well with the topic of the week. 3.
